		<p>The interface {@link org.formulacompiler.describable.Describable} is implemented by classes
			supporting complex, often multi-line descriptions of themselves. Buildup of these descriptions is
			typically done in a {@code StringBuilder} for performance reasons. This makes it easy and fast to
			incorporate subobjects's descriptions.</p>
		
		<p>The specialized {@link org.formulacompiler.describable.DescriptionBuilder} supports proper indentation in a
			structured way.</p>
