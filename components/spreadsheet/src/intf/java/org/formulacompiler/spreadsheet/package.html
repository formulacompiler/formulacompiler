		<p>Contains the public compile-time API of AFC's spreadsheet compiler, which extends the core functional
			model compiler. All of the functionality is accessed using the factory methods in {@link
			org.formulacompiler.spreadsheet.SpreadsheetCompiler}. This class inherits from {@link
			org.formulacompiler.compiler.FormulaCompiler}, which contains only the elements necessary for
			compiling functional model, as well as loading and using engines at run-time.</p>
		
		<p>For most uses, you should be able to confine yourself to the types defined here and in {@link
			org.formulacompiler.runtime}.</p>
