Here's a blurb that was used for announcing AFC on freshmeat, javalobby, and java.net:

> The Abacus Formula Compiler (AFC) compiles computations defined in spreadsheet files directly to Java byte code. Users can thus customize an application using Excel or OpenOffice.org. AFC compiles against your own Java interfaces to obtain input values and compute output values (it essentially generates strategy implementations for you), and supports internal computations with either double or BigDecimal (for financial applications).

> We're proud to finally announce the first public release of AFC under the GPLv3. AFC was developed for use within the Abacus ERP Suite, but always with the aim of releasing it as open-source once it was mature enough.
