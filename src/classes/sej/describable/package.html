<p>The interface {@link sej.describable.Describable} is implemented by classes supporting complex, 
often multi-line descriptions of themselves. Buildup of these descriptions is 
typically done in an StringBuilder for performance reasons. This makes it easy 
and fast to incorporate subobjects' descriptions.</p>

<p>The specialized {@link sej.describable.DescriptionBuilder} supports proper indentation in a
structured way.</p>
