h1. Refactoring the Reference Tests

Goals:

	* Better reporting of tests run, and of failures.
	* Better concurrent execution of tests.
	* Easier to add new test variant dimensions.

Dimensions today, and in the near future:

	* Numeric type
	* Caching
	* Resettable
	* Compatibility mode (Excel, OOo, etc.)
	* Bound inputs

Test structure:

	* Run a test row with a given input binding spec and engine.
	* Differentiate value results and exception results.
	* Produce an engine for a row with a given input binding spec.
	* Produce input and output values for a row (assuming full input binding).
	* Setup tests for a test row varying bound inputs.
	* Setup tests for a sheet.
	* Setup tests varying the fixed dimensions; can drive either a sheet or a row test builder.

Producing the documentation:

	* Separate DocumentationBuilder.
