<p>Some applications may wish to use SEJ to compile computation engines, but want users to be able to specify simple computations without having to setup a spreadsheet. These can use a builder to dynamically construct a spreadsheet as input to SEJ.</p><div class="toc">

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Consider again the main example for SEJ, the <a href="reason.htm">order line item rebate computation</a>. We solved the problem of allowing distributors and customers to customize the computation by letting them specify their own computations <a href="basics.htm">as spreadsheets</a>, such as this one:</p>
<p>[xc:testdata/sej/tutorials/Basics.xls]</p>
<p>Maybe many of your users must define their own, typically very simple, custom computations. Maybe there are a great many points in your application, where they want to do this (not just the line item rebate). In such a case you may want to offer your users a simple UI for defining straightforward custom computations (like, for instance, one liners), but still allow them to switch to a spreadsheet for more complex cases. Users thus might be able to define, right in your UI, the following formula:</p>
<pre>Rebate = CustomerRebate + ArticleRebate</pre>

<p>How can you implement this? Remember that we already factored out the actual computation as a <em>strategy</em>. So a straightforward approach is to implement a new strategy, which is effectively an interpreter for the simple one-line formulas (or whatever your UI allows users to specify).</p>
<p>If you expect these computations to be used heavily in your application, however, it may be worthwhile to harness SEJ to generate true byte-code computations for these formulas, instead of interpreting them. A side benefit of this approach will be that you can give users switching from a simple formula to a full blown spreadsheet a head start by letting SEJ <a href="generatesheet.htm">generate an initial spreadsheet</a> implementing the currently defined formula.</p>

<h2><a name="building">Building Your Own Spreadsheet Model</a></h2>
<p>SEJ's compiler takes an internal representation of a spreadsheet as input. Normally, you load this from an actual spreadsheet file. With the <a href="../javadoc/sej/SpreadsheetBuilder.html"><tt>SpreadsheetBuilder</tt></a>, however, you can build one in memory from scratch. I'll first show you how to define the spreadsheet with only the two input cells:</p>
<p>[jc:sej.tutorials.Basics:---- OwnUISheet; omit -- defCalc]</p>
<p>The method <tt>b.cst()</tt> is a factory method for constant values. It accepts all the types of constant value that SEJ supports, for example <tt>String</tt> and <tt>Number</tt>.</p>
<p>Of particular interest is how to build calculated cells, <tt>B1+B2</tt> in this example. Here's the same method again, showing how the calculated cell is defined:</p>
<p>[jc:sej.tutorials.Basics:---- OwnUISheet; highlight -hlCalc-; strip -- defCalc; strip]</p>
<p>The <tt>currentCell()</tt> method returns a reference to the cell defined just before it. These references can be used later on in formulas to reference other cells.</p>
<p>The part <tt>b.op( Operator.PLUS, ... )</tt> defines the last cell as one performing an addition, which is one of the supported <a href="../javadoc/sej/Operator.html">operators</a>. Its arguments are references to the two cells defined above. There is also <tt>fun()</tt> for <a href="../javadoc/sej/Function.html">functions</a>, and <tt>agg()</tt> for <a href="../javadoc/sej/Aggregator.html">aggregators</a>.</p>

<h2>Switching To A Spreadsheet File</h2>
<p>When users find the simple formula UI too limited, they will want to switch to using a full-blown spreadsheet. As noted above, you can give them a head start by having SEJ <a href="generatesheet.htm#generate">generate the initial spreadsheet</a> for them. This spreadsheet then implements the current simple formula as a starting point for further customization.</p>        </div>
