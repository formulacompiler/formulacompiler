h1. Granting Of Rights For Contributions

As AFC is a "dual-licensed":../download/license.htm product, Abacus needs sufficient rights to your contributions in order to integrate them.

*Missing:* Sorry, the exact wording of the _Contributor License Agreement_ is not yet finalized. Please contact support@formulacompiler.org for details on our progress.

In any case, the agreement will either transfer copyright to Abacus and relicense back to you rights as broad as possible (as in the "OpenLaszlo Agreement":http://www.openlaszlo.org/development/process/), or else make you license very broad rights to Abacus (as in the "Innotek Agreement":http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/ICA).
