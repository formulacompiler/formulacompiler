h1. Developer's Journal

This is an unstructured journal regarding the development of AFC. I use it to keep track of ideas, goals and discussion notes. Note that the former name of AFC was SEJ (Spreadsheet Engine for Java).

Check the "release notes":../releasenotes.htm for what's already been done.
