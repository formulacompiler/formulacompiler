Thank you! You want to contribute to SEJ. I appreciate it. In these pages I will tell you how to go about it.

We have to cover quite a bit of ground. This is because SEJ was -- and is -- developed with great attention to quality. But never fear, the examples will make it all clear.

h2. House Rules

When developing for "Eclipse":-ec, you need to follow its "house rules":-ecrules. They help you and everyone else produce a consistent and high-quality product. It's the same with SEJ, only we have fewer rules. Here they are:

	# Document first
	# Cite tested examples
	# Mimick existing code
	# Implement only what the tests require

Simple enough. Now go see them in action: "add a missing function":addfunction.htm. That will make them clear.
