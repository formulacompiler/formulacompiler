h1. Adding A New Array Computation To SEJ

An array computation is a (typically financial) function that computes a single value from an array of values. Here, we shall look at how I implemented @NPV()@. So let's assume @NPV()@ has not been implemented yet.

_Note: You must have read the topics on adding "primitive functions":-prim and "high-level functions":-high to understand this section._

h2. Docs and Tests

As always, we start with the announcement in the release notes, and the tests:

	[xc:testdata/sej/tests/reference/FinancialFunctions.xls:HeaderRange,NPVRange]

	
h2. Parsing

Making @NPV()@ known to the parser is much like what we did for @ABS()@. Array functions, however, need to accept array arguments, not just simple values. These are denoted by @shapedrangeexpr@:

		...
		|	NPV LPAREN expr:rate COMMA shapedrangeexpr:vals RPAREN
				{: RESULT = new ExpressionNodeForFunction( Function.NPV, rate, vals ); :}
		...


h2. Mathematical Definition
	
The function @NPV()@ is defined in the Excel help file as follows:

<notextile><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='block'>
	<munderover><mo lspace="thinmathspace" rspace="thinmathspace">&#8721;</mo> <mrow><mi>i</mi>
	<mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow> <mi>n</mi></munderover>
	<mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>values</mi> <mi>i</mi></msub>
	</mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo>
	<mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>rate</mi><msup><mo>)</mo> <mi>i</mi></msup></mrow></mfrac>
</math></notextile>

What we need here is a "folding function":-refrewrite that gives us access to the current index @i@. @_FOLD_ARRAY()@ does this.


h2. Rewriting It

@_FOLD_ARRAY()@ expects an _array_ to fold, not just a list of values as @_FOLD()@ does. We can make SEJ compile the parsed value range into an array using the @#@-suffix notation:

	[jc:sej.internal.build.rewriting.RewriteRulesCompiler:---- fun_NPV]

Note how I used @_LET()@ here to move the common subexpression out of the folding loop.
